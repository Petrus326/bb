<t>THE CERTIFIED BLACMAN</t>
<b >
<h1>What is a blacman ?</h1>
<p1>A blacman is a man of great standard, in other words<br> a men who gets the job done no matter the challenges faced</p1>
<p2>There are only two real Blackman in this universe.<br>
<strong>Petrus — The Hammer.</strong><br>
<strong>Collin — The Blade, also known as Otaku.</strong><br><br>

They don’t waste time with talk or warnings.<br> When they move, it’s because the job needs to be done <br> and it will be done, no matter what.<br><br>

Petrus is built like a fortress and moves with deadly precision. Behind the wheel, he’s untouchable <br> no one catches him, no one outdrives him.<br> In a fight, he’s pure force, a silent storm that breaks bones and shatters resistance. <br>They call him Batman because even the darkest nights can’t hide him.<br> One strike from Petrus and everything changes <br> usually for the worse if you’re on the other side.<br><br>

Collin, known as Otaku, is the sharp mind with an edge sharper than any blade.<br> He studies every weapon, every weakness, every opening. He’s cold, calculating, and never misses. <br>His plans come together like clockwork, and when he makes his move,<br> it’s clean and final. Collin doesn’t just fight — he ends fights before they begin.<br><br>

They aren’t friends or partners. They’re a force of nature, unstoppable and merciless.<br> Where they go, chaos follows <br>but only for their enemies.<br><br>

If you hear their names whispered in fear, understand one thing: the battle is already lost.<br>
<strong>Petrus and Collin — The Hammer and The Blade.You don’t want to be in their way.</strong><br>
